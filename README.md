# Incredible India CSOC

This project tells us about the contributions of athletes and sportsmen towards India by winning glorified medals at The COMMONWEALTH GAMES 2022.

On the occasion of the 75th Independence Day, we have collected information related to the above from the web and presented it to viewers in the best possible way. This project is completely based on HTML and CSS.

The sportsmen have shown their patriotism towards our country by winning the hearts of people at the Commonwealth Games. Their achievements have been possible due to their hard work and the support provided by various government Yojanas or plans. My next goal is to add that information to this website in a more presentable way.

I have used some YouTube references as instructed by my mentors.
